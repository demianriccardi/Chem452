    "## Ability to work with vectors is prerequisite to carrying out structural analysis of biological molecules.\n",
    "At a given temperature, pressure, and molar constitution $G(T,P,n_1,n_2 ... )$, a biological molecule (or collection of molecules) has a space of available conformations or configurations that may be large ($S=k\\ln W$).  If you were to carry out a molecular dynamics simulation (which we will come back to later), you would most likely prepare your system using a single structure provided by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, solvate your system in water (maybe with salt ions), and then add some heat so that it wiggles about.  \n",

All this extra information is where the story telling comes in, all the rigorous analysis is in the handling of the coordinates, which can be treated as vectors.\n",

However, we do know this corresponds to benzene so we can hypothesize what atoms these correspond to! In Benzene, carbons are around 1.4 angstroms apart, due to conjugation.
