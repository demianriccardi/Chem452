#Earlham College Spring 2015: Biophysical chemistry 452 

##Course Description

Biophysical chemistry 452 develops and applies the principles of chemical thermodynamics and kinetics to understand condensed phase biochemical processes. Classical thermodynamics provides mathematically accessible (with some work!) explanations of our everyday experiences (e.g. temperature, heat flow, buoyancy, etc.).  This macroscopic field of science predates atoms and molecules. Thus, the tenets of thermodynamics are conceptually abstract to chemists and biochemists. On the other hand, statistical mechanics provides the microscopic molecular connections to the same macroscopic thermodynamic observations but requires more technical mathematics. The goal of this course is to build analytical tools and intuition that will enhance our understanding of biomolecular transformations between thermodynamically relevant states under varied conditions. To accomplish this goal, we will reside in the sweet spot between microscopic and macroscopic theories; that is, we will use molecular information to explore microscopic interpretations of macroscopic observations. This course is four credits: three credit hours are allotted to the lecture/discussion portion, and the fourth credit is assigned to the laboratory component. Credits will be assessed by your presence, preparedness, participation, and quality of written work.

##Repository Description
This repository contains example jupyter notebooks and exercises in support of the laboratory component of the class.
