## 15 minute exercises

These exercises are designed to take less than 15 minutes (perhaps much less) for experienced users.  For new users, these exercises will likely take more than 15 minutes, maybe much more... that is until the user is no longer a new user!  Each 15 minute exercise should focus on a core competency and be fun to do, if possible.
