## 15 minute exercises

These exercises are designed to take less than 15 minutes (perhaps much less) for experienced users.  For new users, these exercises will likely take more than 15 minutes, maybe much more... that is until the user is no longer a new user!  Each 15 minute exercise should focus on a core competency and be fun to do, if possible.  Our advice is to commit to work the exercise for 15 minutes and then longer if you feel up to it.  Then come back and repeat until you have mastered the exercise. Keep time and see how fast you can complete it.

### Assumptions
The main assumption for this exercise is that you can open a terminal window. When you open a terminal, it loads a shell 
that provides you a bunch of useful commands for messing around with your file system.  For Chem-452, you will typically 
do this in two ways:

  1. on a macbook open the terminal.app, which is in /Applications/Utilities/ directory. You can navigate the finder and 
  double click the application or you can do a spotlight search (watchglass in the upper right) for "Terminal".

  2. logging into JupyterHub will give you access to a launching window. You can launch a Terminal (or a Notebook) from the 
  button labled "New" in the upper right.
