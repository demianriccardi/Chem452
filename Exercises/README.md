## 15 minute exercises

These exercises are designed to take less than 15 minutes (perhaps much less) for experienced users.  For new users, these exercises will likely take more than 15 minutes, maybe much more... that is until the user is no longer a new user!  Each 15 minute exercise should focus on a core competency and be fun to do, if possible.  Our advice is to commit to work the exercise for 15 minutes and then longer if you feel up to it.  Then come back and repeat until you have mastered the exercise. Keep time and see how fast you can complete it.
