##15 minute exercise: slicing and dicing text files using the Vi editor 

##Description
vi is a text editor that has a lot of features.  It is a little weird at first, but the weirdness pay dividends in time-savings later.  This exercise will get you started using vi to create and edit files.

## Commands
  * vi       
  * mkdir
  * cd

## Vi modes:  when you open a file for editing, your intuition is to be able to "get writing". However, 
  * default mode: when you `vi some.txt` you are in a mode that feels rigid.    
  * insert mode
