##15 minute exercise: using git and GitHub to maintain and share your work. 

##Description
Git and GitHub are different things.  Git is a commandline program that you can use to keep track of you projects.  You make a directory, you initiate git in that directory to keep track of things, and then as you carry out your work, you make commits to your project repository.  It's incredibly powerful.  For example, if you make a disasterous mistake, you can just rewind you repository to a place where things were working as expected.  GitHub is a place up in the cloud that you can push work to and pull your work from.  It is free as long as you make your projects publicly accessable.  It is a giant space containing tons of cool things that you can work from.  In fact you are reading this description on GitHub, and you can build on the tools you have learned in the linux exercise to interact with this repository in a much more sophisticated way.  That's what we are going to do here.  However, we will only scratch the surface here.
