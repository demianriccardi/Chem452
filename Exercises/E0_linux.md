#Messing around with the File System from the shell environment: With power comes responsibility. 

## Exercise Description
In this exercise you will walk around your directory tree take in the sights, make some mess, and then clean it up.  We will introduce some ideas to help you organize your computational work. 


### Assumptions
The main assumption for this exercise is that you can open a terminal window. When you open a terminal, it loads a shell that provides you a bunch of useful commands for messing around with your file system.  For Chem-452, you will typically do this in two ways:

  1. on a macbook open the terminal.app, which is in /Applications/Utilities/ directory. You can navigate the finder and double click the application or you can do a spotlight search (watchglass in the upper right) for "Terminal".

  2. logging into JupyterHub will give you access to a launching window. You can launch a Terminal (or a Notebook) from the button labled "New" in the upper right. 

## List of shell commands you will use in this exercise 

* man
* pwd
* ls
* cd
* mkdir
* touch
* rm

## The exercise

  1. Access the documentation (aka "man pages") for each of the above commands, and make a note of what each does. "man" is short for manual. For example, typing 'man man' will display the documentation for the "man" command.     
  2. ...
